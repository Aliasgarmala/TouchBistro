# TouchBistro

This is the sample app that utilizes the BillEngine framework to calculate Bill items.

* I have continued on MVVM architecture that was already in place. For readability and maintainability purposes I have separated into individual ViewModel files.
* There's a small generic class called Box which assists in 2 way binding.
* Carthage is used for dependency on the BillEngine framework. There's no other dependency

* Please contact me if you have any questions. I can be reached at aliasgar.mala@gmail.com
